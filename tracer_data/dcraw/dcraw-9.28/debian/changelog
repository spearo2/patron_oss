    in JPEG/TIFF write routines. The patch has been applied by hand
    to reflect latest upstream source code changes. Closes: #721232
  * Fixed Index overflow in smal_decode_segment() bug. I patched also

    usr/bin/dcraw Optio Option". The character string is correct
    designating Pentax Optio cameras.
