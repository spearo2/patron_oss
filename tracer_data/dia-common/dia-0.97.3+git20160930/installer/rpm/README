This directory contains dia.spec files for various distributions.  The
dia.spec file can be used as a template at first, but will be removed
later.  Maintainers of Dia on various distributions should update the spec
files as things like package names change.  The files should be named to
indicate which distribution they belong to, e.g. dia.spec.suse or
dia.spec.redhat.el3.

This step has been necessary because distributions cannot agree to what
their packages are called, mainly, but also some other details differ, and
I will not spend my time trying to fix one file back and forth. If a
distribution maintainer does not have CVS access, I am willing to apply
patches for them.
