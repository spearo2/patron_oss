How to configure, build, and install SANE-FRONTENDS.

Quick install:
==============

./configure
make
make install        


Type `./configure --help' for a list of options.

Prerequisites:

- GNU make version 3.70 or later and an ANSI C-Compiler (e.g. gcc) is needed
  for compilation. It may be necessary to specify the path to GNU make and the
  compiler by setting the environment variables MAKE and CC before running
  configure.

- You must install the sane-backends package before you can configure this
  package. If you use pre-compiled binaries (e.g. from your distribution) you
  will also have to install the SANE headers (maybe in a package called
  sane-devel or similar). In this case you also need the -devel packages for
  all the software sane-backends depends on (e.g. libusb). If you're lucky,
  your distribution took care of that. Otherwise run sane-config --libs and
  make sure that the -devel packages for all the libraries mentioned in the
  output are installed.

- For xscanimage and xcam you need the X Window libraries and headers.
  Furthermore GTK version 0.99.13 (or 1.0.*, 1.2.*, 2.0.*) must be installed
  together with its header files. GTK can be found at http://www.gtk.org/. For
  some operating systems it's necessary to set the path to gtk-config
  explicitely. This can be done by using the environment variable
  GTK_CONFIG. For FreeBSD try `GTK_CONFIG=/usr/X11R6/bin/gtk12-config'.

- If you want to use xscanimage as a GIMP plug-in, the GIMP libraries and
  headers are necessary. See http://www.gimp.org/. See also `man xscanimage'.
  Versions 1.2.*, and 2.0.* are known to work.

- If you get an error message that libsane-dll.so.1 or libsane-so.1 is not
  found, you have to tell your system where the SANE-libraries are installed.
  On some systems the library directory `/usr/local/lib' is not searched by
  the system's dynamic library loader. If SANE is installed in `/usr/local/...'
  you have to tell your system's dynamic library loader to search in
  `/usr/local/lib'. For Linux: add the path `/usr/local/lib' to
  /etc/ld.so.conf and call ldconfig (as root). Another approach is to set the
  environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH (or the equivalent on other operating
  systems) to `/usr/local/lib'.

- OS/2: If you get errors like this one: "xcam.o: Undefined symbol
  _pthread_write referenced from text segment", libpthread must be linked.
  Find "gtk-config" on your system and add "-lpthreads" to the list of
  libraries.

Uninstall
=========

To uninstall the binaries and manual pages, type `make uninstall'.
