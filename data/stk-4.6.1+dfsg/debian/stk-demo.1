.SH NAME
stk-demo \- Sound Synthesis Toolkit demo application
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B stk-demo
Instrument
.RI [ options ]
.br
.B STKDemo

.SH DESCRIPTION

The stk-demo program demonstrates several of the algorithms that are built
into the Sound Synthesis Toolkit (STK). The stk-demo is a command line
program, but it has a GUI frontend called STKDemo. Use STKDemo if you  want
to try out the different synthesis algorithms implemented in STK.
.PP
The stk-demo program can be used to build your own synthesizer/sequencer
combination. The program is listening to SKINI commands on stdin. 
.PP
.B Instrument
can be one of the following:
.PP
Clarinet, BlowHole, Saxofony, Flute, Brass, BlowBotl, Bowed, Plucked, 
StifKarp, Sitar, Mandolin, Rhodey, Wurley, TubeBell, HevyMetl, PercFlut,

.PP
Simultaneous multiple output types are supported.
Likewise, simultaneous control input types are supported.
SKINI formatted scorefiles can be piped or redirected
to stk-demo, though realtime control flags should be omitted
when doing so. If the optional <file names> are not
specified, default names will be indicated.  Each flag
must include its own '-' sign.
