darktable (1.0-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * Darktable has changed the storage method for preferences from gconf to
    a flat file $HOME/.config/darktable/darktablerc. There is no automatic
    migration method for preferences, but you may find the command
    "gconftool-2 -R /apps/darktable" useful if you need to view previous
    settings.
