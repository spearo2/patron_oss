dia (0.97.3+git20160930-8.2) unstable; urgency=medium

  The python interface to dia has been disabled since Python 2 will
  soon go end of life. If you have a need for the python interface
  you might want to investigate if the dia flatpak can suit your needs,
  as that (still as of right now) seems to carry the python2 parts.
