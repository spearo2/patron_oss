CCCD 0.3beta4

This is a maintenance release. Sven Riedel, the original author has passed
cccd over to me, and I have started working on it. Please refer to 
README.original for usage hints.

Installation for RPM based systems:
Use rpm -tb cccd-0.3beta4.tar.gz to build a binary RPM for cccd. Use
rpm -i or your favourite tool to install.

Installation without RPM:
1. Review the Makefile. Check the location of the "mail" command and
   choose the CFLAGS to suite your taste. 
2. A different installation directory can be specified by using
   make install prefix=/your/dir

Additional hints:
1. Make sure you have read permissions for the CD drive, not only
   for /dev/cdrom (usually a link)
2. If you want to store CDDB entries on your local disk, configure a path
   location via the CDDB tab of the info dialog (e.g. /home/yourname/.cddb).
   Create this path and some subdirectories, which will act as category
   folders. You do not need to follow the original CDDB categories.

Limitations:
o CDDB related GUI elements need checking (done)
o spits out tons of ugly debug messages (switched off in Makefile)
o handling of multisession CDs needs more testing
o no CDDB through a proxy/firewall

Known bugs:
Yes, there are some. They used to be on 
http://home.pages.de/~jst/cccd/bugs.html.

If you find a bug or problem, please report it to me using the form 
found in BUGREPORT. Also coding help is welcome.
