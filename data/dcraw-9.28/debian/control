Description: decode raw digital camera images
 This utility converts the native (RAW), format of various digital
 cameras into netpbm portable pixmap (.ppm) or TIFF images. Supports
 the following models: Canon, Kodak, Olympus, Nikon, Fuji, Minolta
 and Sigma (see https://www.dechifro.org/dcraw/ for full list)
 Note: This utility does not read directly from the cameras, only
 the files after they have been downloaded, use gphoto2 for that.
