rawtherapee (4.2-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  The location of cache and config folder change with this release again.
  Upstream declared the locations stable from now on and calls them
  "RawTherapee" from now on. This means you will find the cache and config
  folders in ~/.cache/RawTherapee and ~/.config/RawTherapee.

  * If ~/.cache/RawTherapee and ~/.config/RawTherapee exist on your system,
    please delete them as they belong to old versions of RawTherapee and
    upgrading form these is not supported upstream.

  * To preserve preferences and cached thumbnails you have to move 
    ~/.cache/RawTherapee-4.1 and ~/.config/RawTherapee-4.1 to
    ~/.cache/RawTherapee and ~/.config/RawTherapee.

rawtherapee (4.1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  The location of cache and config folder change with this release. This means
  your preferences and cached thumbnails will be lost. This is intended by
  upstream. The reasons for this are as follows:

  * Some users have not checked Preferences in a long time, and their program
    is tuned for what worked best long ago, not for what works best now. Our
    defaults are good ones, we keep them up to date to make RawTherapee look 
    and function well out-of-the-box, so having 4.1 start with fresh defaults
    is a good thing, and it will motivate users to look into Preferences again.

  * Some users have never looked inside Preferences and are not aware of some
    of the features that can be unlocked there. As above, fresh defaults will 
    activate these things.

  * Some old cache and config files can cause RawTherapee to crash. While we
    have patched the specific cases made known to us, it is safe to assume
    there are still cases unknown to us which will still cause instability.
    Starting with clean cache and config folders mitigates this problem.

  You find the old cache and config folders in ~/.cache/RawTherapee and
  ~/.config/RawTherapee. It's safe to delete them.
